# hello-world
Git assignment for CodeDay Labs

My name is Ian Rones. I transitioned out of the military and am now studying to receive my BS in Compute Science. I love hiking and climbing, any outdoor activity and riding my motorcycle when I'm not working on code. I am extremely passionate about creating amazing and creative web pages which is why I enjoy front end languages like Javascript and frameworks such as React.
